            RHYTHMS MOVEMENT &amp; AURA-SOMA </span></b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>For 
            a number of years I have been attending ongoing movement workshops. 
            I originally became involved by accident (and we all know there are 
            no accidents!). I had attended a weekend on the Celtic Goddesses which 
            I expected would be explored through art. We began with some movement. 
            I threw myself into it expecting it to last only 5 -10 minutes at 
            most. After 2 ½ hours we were still moving and I was exhausted. It 
            eventually dawned on me this was a MOVEMENT workshop and I had 1 ½ 
            days to go! By lunch time I was ready for the grave and had decided 
            to go home as soon as I told the facilitator. Luckily the session 
            in the afternoon started on the floor so I stayed. 2 hours into it 
            the facilitator introduced a rhythm which she called the Child. Out 
            of nowhere I began to move with great energy in a particularly mad 
            way which I used to do as a child and which I loved. I often ran all 
            the way to school like this and enjoyed it immensely. I was stunned 
            by the energy and enthusiasm which emerged, all aches and pains forgotten. 
            I realised there was something happening I could not explain. </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Subsequently 
            I sought out a movement workshop called the 5 Rhythms (and also the 
            Wave) to attend regularly. This was developed in the US by Gabrielle 
            Roth. I know a number of other people involved with Aura-Soma also 
            attend these types of workshops. The 5 rhythms involved are Flowing, 
            Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical and Stillness. During a workshop one moves 
            through them all in sequence and it feels like a Wave of movement/energy 
            building to a climax and then becoming still. I have personally experienced 
            this as being on the shore - at the end, in stillness, it is a question 
            of what has been washed up on the shore after the Wave has receded? 
            </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>While 
            attending the Intermediate training in Aura-Soma we had been working 
            with numerology and I thought the first 5 numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) 
            shared a lot in common with the themes of the 5 Rhythms. Someone requested 
            me to facilitate a session around this. While I am no expert either 
            on numerology or movement, I am in the habit of creatively experimenting 
            with the unexpected and so I had a go at this for the group. </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>At 
            first we warmed up using Roth's &quot;Bodyparts&quot; tapes. Then 
            we went through each movement with appropriate music (which is usually 
            played very loudly) connecting to the main themes of the numbers and 
            rhythms. What emerged was: </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>0 
            - FLOWING</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>: when we are unconsciously attached to 
            the world, we feel connected to the world, comfortable with what is 
            familiar, regardless of whether it makes us happy. We connect in circles, 
            the connection is in darkness, we are unaware of what is beneath, 
            the deep mystery out of which all things come. Spiritual Rescue, Royal 
            Blue and Deep Magenta. </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'><b>1</b> - <b>STACCATO</b>: Staccata is 
            definite, moves in straight lines, it is the masculine principle. 
            It begins to assert itself out of the circle. It is the beginning 
            of &quot;I Am&quot;, the dawn of a new creation. It has a sense of 
            deliberately getting the energy up, of &quot;get out of my way, I 
            am going somewhere&quot;. Physical Rescue, Blue and Deep Magenta.</span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>2 
            - CHAOS</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>: Chaos is not without pattern, it is a 
            matter of finding the pattern within it and then it can be maintained 
            indefinitely creating a stillness that is unexpected. 1 is joined 
            by another, the feminine principle. It creates conflict and raises 
            the energy further. It brings the possibility of creation. Peace, 
            Blue. </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>3- 
            LYRICA</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>L: In Lyrical we are uninhibitedly creative. 
            The lyrical is the child within, what has been created, the third 
            which has arisen out of the 1 &amp; 2. It is creative and original, 
            light, fresh and enthusiastic. The Heart, Blue and Green </span></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>4 
            - STILLNESS</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>: Stability and form. Sunlight, Yellow and 
            Gold. A return to the 0 with what has been left on the shore. This 
            in turn will become the 5th, the quintessence, what has been distilled 
            from the experience, transcending the limitations of 4. And so the 
            Wave will repeat itself in the future with another forward movement, 
            each time bringing more out of the dark, moving more into what it 
            is to be human. </span></font></p>
