mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>From the very dawn of humanity (until 
            today), people have looked to the heavens and the planets for guidance. 
            Thousands of years ago astrology was, generally speaking, reserved 
            only for members of royalty. There were good points to astrology being 
            embraced by royalty, and there were several bad points. One of the 
            best advantages was that an astrologer could look forward to a nice, 
            comfortable, civil service job in the palace. One of the worst &quot;difficulties&quot; 
            was when the astrologer inevitably made the royal benefactor angry. 
            That was when the court astrologer generally lost his/her head over 
            the matter. And I am speaking literally regarding the losing of heads.</span><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>The roots of Western Tropical astrology 
            (the type of astrology most Westerners are familiar with today) date 
            all the way back to ancient Mesopotamia (2300 BC). From there, perhaps 
            as early as 600 BC, astrology began making its way into ancient Greece. 
            Astrology's entrance into Greece coincided with the beginning of the 
            first great Greek philosophers and with the rise of the Greek state 
            and culture. Socrates - 469 to 399 BC Plato - 427 to 347 BC Aristotle 
            - 384 to 322 BC Then Alexander the Great burst into the picture by 
            beginning his famous conquests over much of the entire (then known) 
            world. Alexander's conquests began and then lasted between the years 
            of 336-323 BC. Due to Alexander's powerful influence and control - 
            and his having been tutored by the master philosopher Aristotle - 
            Greek culture and thought was then spread throughout Alexander's vast 
            conquered domain. In this process of &quot;hellenizing&quot; the world 
            - Alexandria, Egypt became the established cultural center of ancient 
            Hellenistic Greek thought and philosophy between the years of 323 
            - 31 BC. It was during this 300 year period of time that the study, 
            development, and acceptance of astrology flourished among the prominent 
            thinkers of the day... and it was during this period of time, when 
            horoscopic, zodiacal, individualized astrology - much as we recognize 
            it today - first came into existence. In the Hellenistic Greek atmosphere, 
            astrology was no longer reserved for royalty. Later ancient Hellenistic 
            sky watchers such as the famous Ptolemy (85-165 AD) served in dual 
            roles as both the scientifically minded mathematical astronomer searching 
            out the skies and as the metaphysically minded astrologer divining 
            the purposes of the heavens.</span><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>After a several hundred year “heyday” 
            in ancient Greek and then Roman culture - astrology in the Western 
            world, while never totally dying out, became rather quiet during the 
            period of time now called the Middle Ages. During this time, astrology 
            continued to flourish and evolve in other parts of the world. However, 
            in fourth century AD, the Christian Church was busily at work establishing 
            itself as the predominant Western world political power and belief 
            system during the next several hundred years. Suffice to say that 
            during the Church's rule in the medieval period, the Church in Rome 
            vacillated back and forth over its official viewpoint and level of 
            tolerance regarding astrology. At times Christian church leaders condemned 
            astrology and astrologers as being heretical, while at other times 
            church leaders sought out the guidance of astrologers. According to 
            historian Valerie Flint (&quot;The Rise of Magic In Early Medieval 
            Europe&quot;), in the early Middle Ages, some Christian church leaders 
            actually encouraged a belief in astrology in order to keep believers 
            away from what seemed to be more dangerous magical practices. Some 
            church officials during this very large span of time, such as French 
            Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly (1350-1420), were practicing astrologers.</span><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>For the most part, in the Western world, 
            astrology kept its low profile until a reemergence during the European 
            Renaissance (ranging in date anywhere from 1453 - 1598 to as late 
            as the 1670s). Spurred on in Italy by the Medicis, philosopher/astrologer/Catholic 
            priest Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), and the revival of Greek neo-Platonic 
            philosophies - astrology once again began gaining prominence among 
            many of the scholastics of the day. During the European Renaissance 
            (ranging from 1453 - 1670) the vast majority of Western astrologers 
            were practicing Christians. One of the more notable astrologers during 
            the latter Renaissance period, William Lilly (1602-1681), remonikered 
            astrology as being &quot;Christian Astrology,&quot; although it's 
            generally thought that this was much in order to keep the still rather 
            powerful (and vacillating) Christian church leadership at bay. The, 
            all too brief, European Renaissance was then followed by the bright 
            rationalistic light of the Age of Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution 
            of the 17th century AD, with the scholastic world finally determining, 
            once and for all, that the Earth was not the center of the universe.</span><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>What we today take for granted, knowing 
            the Earth to be a small cog in the greater wheel of the universe, 
            was - for the peoples of that time and age - a huge shift in consciousness. 
            It’s literally impossible for us to imagine how chaotic and devastating 
            this paradigm shift and “ideological earthquake” was to become or 
            how effective it would be in rocking the religious world of the day. 
            Astrology was only one among a much larger group of metaphysical aftershock 
            casualties of this mind bending paradigm shift. As a result of this 
            “ideological earthquake,” the physical science of astronomy and the 
            metaphysical art of astrology began the slow process of being split 
            off from one another - and, for the first time, they became separate, 
            often contrary disciplines. While astronomy blossomed under the watchful 
            eye and blessing of the new Age of Enlightenment - mystically minded 
            astrology was cursed and cast aside under its disdainful, disapproving 
            glare... Once again, Western astrology began disappearing into the 
            mist, shadows, and darkness. At the same time, it would be a mistake 
            to say that the practice of astrology totally died out as a result 
            of the Age of Enlightenment.</span><span

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>Then, around 150-180 years ago, astrology 
            in Western society slowly began rising up once more into public favor, 
            imagination, and consciousness. At the beginning of the 20th century, 
            a final grand revival of astrology came about owing much to the efforts 
            of the charismatic, enigmatic, and controversial astrologers, Sepharial 
            (1864 - 1929) and Alan Leo (1860-1917), who became the founding fathers 
            of the Astrological Lodge of the Theosophical Society in Great Britain. 
            Since Sepharial and Leo’s time, Western culture’s fascination with 
            astrology has continued on with us and grown and evolved through the 
            years. It was during this final 20th century pop revival of Western 
            astrology that Sun Sign Astrology (Hey baby! What’s your sign?), ideas 
            on karma and reincarnation, and the reading of daily horoscopes first 
            began coming into vogue. According to esteemed astrologer, Dane Rudhyar, 
            at the beginning of the 1930's, astrologer Paul Clancy decided that 
            popularizing astrology was to be his life mission. When Clancy's magazine 
            &quot;American Astrology&quot; became a huge success in 1934, it started 
            a new &quot;epoch&quot; in astrology. It was primarily Clancy's venture 
            in &quot;American Astrology&quot; that brought about the popularity 
            of daily and/or weekly astrological horoscope columns, with readings 
            of the twelve signs, to appear in the newspapers and periodicals throughout 
            the United States and Europe. (from the preface of &quot;Astrology, 
            The Divine Science&quot; by written by Marcia Moore and Mark Douglas) 
            What the esteemed and quite respected astrologer, Dane Rudhyar, failed 
            to mention in his preface is that it was none other than he, Dane 
            Rudhyar, who was the original writer of these popular &quot;American 
            Astrology&quot; horoscopes.</span><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>You may be at the stage of asking, &quot;What 
            is a horoscope?&quot; If so, you're going to find the answers here. 
            To begin, the horoscope is a map that appears as a two dimensional 
            chart. It shows the position of the Sun, the Moon, and planets at 
            the precise moment of your birth. The planets are frozen in their 
            position at that initial moment of birth. That is why this type of 
            horoscope is known as the birth chart or the natal chart. A correct 
            interpretation of these birth positions exposes much about you. It 
            can be thought of as the &quot;hand&quot; that has been &quot;dealt&quot; 
            in life. This doesn't suggest that your life has already been decided. 
            A horoscope can never show how you are going to &quot;play&quot; this 
            hand. It's largely up to you to decide that.</span><span style='font-family:

mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black'>While you usually have freedom of choice 
            or free will, the horoscope does reflect the natural inclinations 
            you have, the lessons you have to learn, the issues to be faced, and 
            the problems to be solved. It may be thought of as merely an abstract 
            formula showing the energies you've been given, or perhaps tasked. 
            The use that you make of these energies, or opportunities, if you 
            will, depends upon you, the individual. Astrology can provide incredible 
            keys to understanding, but it doesn't necessarily provide clear and 
            simplistic answers to any problems with which you may be dealing. 
            Obtaining information about your horoscope may give you some insights 
            and understanding of the reasons why you behave as you do.</span><span
