          the seven colours of the spectrum, Colour Therapy aims to balance and 
          enhance our body's energy centres / Chakras and also to help stimulate 
          our body's own healing process. Colour Therapy uses colour to re-balance 
          the Chakras (our energy centres) that have become depleted of energy. 
          Each of the seven colours of the spectrum, resonates with one of the 
          main seven chakras of the body. These chakras are like spirals of energy, 
          each one relating to the others. Colour has a profound effect on us 
          on all levels, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. If our energy 
          centres become blocked or depleted, then our body cannot function properly 
          and this, in turn, can lead to a variety of problems on any level. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Colour 
          therapy is used for adults and children or babies alike and is also 
          very helpful in the treatment of animals. Colour has been used for healing 
          at least since the Ancient Egyptian times. It is now being used again 
          today to help people from all over the world. Colour Therapy uses colour 
          to balance the Chakras of the body Each of the spectrum colours is simply 
          light of varying wavelengths, thus each color has its own particular 
          energy. The energy relating to each of these spectrum colours resonates 
          with the energy of each of the seven main chakras of the body. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Chakra 
          is the Sanskrit word for 'wheel'. If you can imagine the chakras/energy 
          centres as a set of cogs/wheels, they are rather like the workings of 
          a clock or an engine; each cog /wheel needs to move smoothly and at 
          a similar speed for the clock/engine to work properly. Thus good health 
          and well being is achieved by a balance of all these energies (or the 
          smooth running of the cogs/wheels). Colour therapy can help to rebalance 
          these 'wheels' by applying the appropriate color to the body and therefore 
          re balance our chakras. Listed below is each of the spectrum colours 
          and the chakra which it relates to. Violet has the shortest wavelength 
          and red the longest wave length. </span></font></p>

          relates to the crown chakra, and red the base chakra. Colour is absorbed 
          by the eyes, skin and skull and the energy of color can affect us on 
          all levels, that is to say, physical, spiritual and emotional. Every 
          cell in the body needs light energy - thus color energy has widespread 
          affects on the whole body. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Colour 
          has a profound effect on us on all these levels - physical, mental, 
          emotional and spiritual. We are in a world where colour dominates our 
          lives, from reading signs on the road to identifying ripe fruit by its 
          colour. Colour affects our moods - blue is calming - red can make us 
          tense. We use colour everyday in our lives without even appreciating 
          it. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Colour 
          is simply light of different wavelengths and frequencies and light is 
          just one form of energy made up from photons. We are surrounded by electromagnetic 
          waves of energy of which colour is just a small part. The colour spectrum 
          is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to 
          the human eye. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Light 
          is just one particular type of electromagnetic radiation. Other types 
          of electromagnetic radiation include radio waves, infrared radiation 
          (heat), ultraviolet radiation, x-rays and gamma - rays. Each type of 
          radiation is distinguished by its wavelength, or frequency. Light is 
          made up of many frequencies, colour just being a small selection of 
          these frequencies. The colours - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, royal 
          blue, and violet, all emanate from the sun, our provider of light. These 
          7colours become visible when a prism is placed in the path of sunlight. 
          As the light passes through the prism, it is split into the seven visible 
          colours of the spectrum by refraction. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>This 
          is caused by the change in speed experienced by a wave of light when 
          it changes medium. Light is energy. The amount of energy in a given 
          light wave is proportionally related to its frequency, thus a high frequency 
          light wave has a higher energy than that of a low frequency light wave. 
          </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>As 
          we have discovered, each colour has its own particular wavelength and 
          frequency. Each colour is measured in units of cycles or waves per second. 
          If we can imagine light traveling in waves like that in an ocean, it 
          is these waves that have the properties of wavelength and frequency. 
          A wavelength is the distance between the same locations on adjacent 
          waves. As an example; an ocean full of waves, that were 10 metres apart, 
          could be classed as, having a wavelength of 10, whereas an ocean of 
          waves that were 30 metres apart would be classed as having a wavelength 
          of 30. The further the distance apart between to waves the LOWER the 
          wavelength. The same applies to light. The colour RED has a wavelength 
          of around 700 nanometers long - one wave spans only 7 ten millionths 
          of a metre! Whereas, Violet has a much lower wavelength, so each violet 
          wave would span a much larger distance. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Within 
          the Universe, positive and negative charges (waves of energy), are constantly 
          vibrating and producing electromagnetic waves travelling at an incredibly 
          high speed.(186,000 miles per second). Each of these waves has a different 
          wavelength and speed of vibration. Together they form the electromagnetic 
          spectrum. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The 
          frequency of a wave is determined by the number of complete waves, or 
          wavelengths, that pass a given point each second. So back to our example 
          above, an ocean with waves that are 10 metres apart that crash on the 
          shore every 5 seconds could be classed as having a frequency of 5, whereas 
          an ocean of waves 10 metres apart that crashed on the shore every 10 
          seconds, would be classed as having a frequency of 10. The more frequent 
          the waves, the HIGHER the frequency. The colour RED has a frequency 
          of around 430 trillion vibrations a second, whereas Violet has a much 
          higher frequency, so each violet wave would pass a given point much 
          quicker than the colour RED. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>All 
          light travels at the same speed but each color has a different wavelength 
          and frequency. It is these different wavelengths and frequencies that 
          cause the different colors of light to separate and become visible when 
          passing through a prism. This can be looked upon in the same way that 
          radio waves have different frequencies and wavelengths, certain stations 
          can only be listened to at a particular frequency or wavelength. So 
          the colour blue - say, can only be visible at a particular frequency 
          and wavelength range. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Colour 
          Therapy Treatment can be used and applied in many ways. A qualified 
          Colour therapist can assist with what colour to use, by way of a consultation. 
          Colour therapy can be helpful for any problem whether, physical, mental, 
          emotional or spiritual and as a relaxation therapy. However, it should 
          always be remembered that no complementary therapy should be considered 
          as an alternative to professional medical advice. Colour treatment can 
          be given in a number of different ways and, as with any therapy, each 
          therapist may have his or her own 'style'. A Colour therapist will help 
          you to understand your need for a certain colour or colours and also 
          show how you can use these colours in every day life. The first consultation 
          with a qualified Colour Therapist will normally be longer than subsequent 
          visits since time has to be allowed for taking patient details, for 
          the purposes of proper records, and for full discussion of the reason 
          for the visit. The practitioner can then assess the appropriate course 
          of the treatment and discuss the different methods available. </span></font></p>

          and Nature </span></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>When 
          exploring some of the connections of Colour Therapy and Nature, one 
          of the most obvious is, of course, flowers. They are a very big part 
          of the colours we are all used to seeing around us. Nature is full of 
          healing energy and it is there for us all to share and to enjoy. We 
          just need to look. bach flower remedies essential olis aromatherapy 
          lavender It is not only the plants and trees and their flowers and fruits 
          which give us colour, but also the many wonderful creatures who share 
          this planet with us who contribute to the amazing colour palette, and 
          the planet herself. What more dramatic colours could you ask for than 
          the variations of the blues of the sky, the blue/greens of the oceans, 
          and the reds and oranges of sunsets - to name but a few. The subject 
          of Nature is enormous and it would be almost impossible to include every 
          aspect of nature and healing. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Colour 
          and Crystals </span></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The 
          use of crystals in healing is a vast topic. Crystals can be very powerful 
          and are very sensitive. Crystals, like all things, have an energy field 
          - aura - and their different energies can be used to balance/enhance 
          our own body's energies. As with many natural therapies, crystals have 
          been used as a healing aid for centuries. Crystal energy, as colour 
          energy, can help to awaken our awareness, not just of the physical imbalance 
          / dis-ease, but awareness of the psychological, spiritual and emotional 
          aspects of ourselves. Some crystals suit some people better or in different 
          ways than others, but this simply emphasises our uniqueness and our 
          different needs. As with many forms of healing, we take what we need. 
          The choice of a crystal can be simply your body knowing what it needs 
          without the 'interference' of the intellect. This is often apparent 
          when someone who has no experience in crystal healing will instinctively 
          choose a crystal which happens to be the very type which their body 
          requires. There are many ways of using crystals and they can be obtained 
          in different forms; the natural unpolished pieces, tumbled stones, cut 
          points, essences, and pieces of jewellery set with crystals. Essences 
          are similar, in a way, to solarized water in that the crystal is placed 
          in water for a period of time and the specific energy of that crystal 
          is transmitted to the water which is subsequently used for drinking 
          or bathing. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The 
          Body's Main Chakras </span></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>There 
          are seven main energy centres (chakras) of the body. These chakras are 
          like spirals of energy. Each one relating to the others. Chakra (pronounced 
          sha-kra) is the Sanskrit word for ' wheel '. Imagine the chakras/energy 
          centres as a set of cogs/wheels, as illustrated in the animation to 
          the right. They are rather like the workings of a clock or an engine; 
          each cog /wheel needs to move smoothly and at a similar speed for the 
          clock/engine to work properly. Thus good health and well being is achieved 
          by a balance of all these energies (or the smooth running of the cogs/wheels). 
          We can re-charge and balance these energy centres using colour since 
          the energy wavelengths of the seven rainbow colours correspond to the 
          energy wavelengths of these seven main chakras of the body. Violet is 
          the highest colour. It is the colour for the crown chakra at the top 
          of the head, coming down through the body to the brow (royal blue), 
          throat (blue), heart (green), solar plexus (yellow), sacral (orange) 
          and finally to the base/root chakra with red. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Colour 
          therapy can be shown to help on a physical level, which is perhaps easier 
          to quantify, however there are deeper issues around the colours on the 
          psychological and spiritual levels. Our well being is not, of course, 
          purely a physical issue. Fortunately, many more practitioners, both 
          orthodox and complementary are now treating patients in an holistic 
          manner. That is to say, we are body, mind and spirit and none of these 
          areas function entirely alone; each has an effect upon the other. </span></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>This 
          is why Colour Therapy can be so helpful since colour addresses all levels 
          of our being. As babies we first experience colour in the womb where 
          we are enveloped in a nurturing and comforting pink. Then as a child 
          we associate with colour as part of our first learning processes. These 
          first associations contribute to our consciousness. As we get older 
          we attach many different feelings, memories and meanings to certain 
          colours and this can then become a feature in our subconscious. We can 
          build up prejudices to colours which have happy, sad, or frightening 
          connotations for us. All life experiences have an affect upon us. Some 
          experiences will be positive and some negative. It is these negative 
          experiences which can manifest themselves physically over time as dis-ease. 
          As an example:- perhaps we have, over the years, been in a situation 
          where we have felt unable, for one reason or another, to speak our mind, 
          or to express our needs and feelings. This can manifest as a problem 
          in the throat chakra. The throat chakra relates in the spiritual aspect 
          to self expression. Thus, if our self expression has been blocked, the 
          energy in this area will not be free flowing. Working with the appropriate 
          colour/colours can help to dispel negative feelings, free blocks and 
          re-balance the body. </span></font></p>
