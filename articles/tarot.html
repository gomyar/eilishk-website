          things (true, false, and speculative) have been written about the history 
          of the tarot. This sheet addresses some oft-repeated statements about 
          the tarot that may seem like historical fact, but are actually without 
          basis in the evidence presently available. This is not to say that there 
          is no room for speculative or non-factual stories about the tarot. Myths 
          and lore express the human soul and creativity. These myths tell us 
          much about the significance tarot has on an inspirational growth level. 
          They speak an inner truth that is, at times, more personally true than 
          external facts. However, both history and myth may suffer when the two 
          become confused. The information given here consists mostly of conclusions 
          that recent tarot historians have drawn from studying the evidence of 
          written documents and cards that have come down to us. Other interpretations 
          might be drawn from the same body of evidence. Readers interested in 
          examining the evidence for themselves are drawing their own conclusions 
          are directed to the references listed at the end of this sheet for useful 
          starting places. Readers should also be aware of the limitations of 
          relying on documentary evidence alone. Although written records are 
          our most reliable contact with centuries past, they do not preserve 
          everything that people thought or did, especially pertaining to an aspect 
          of popular culture, such as the tarot. </span></font></p>

          The tarot comes from Egypt; India; China; Fez, Morocco; the Sufis; the 
          Cathars; Jewish Kabbalists or Moses; or the origin of the tarot is unknown. 
          CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: The tarot originated in northern Italy 
          early in the 15th century (1420-l440). There is no evidence for it originating 
          in any other time or place. The earliest extant cards are lavish hand-painted 
          decks from the courts of the nobility. </span></font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>INACCURATE: 
          The word is Egyptian, Hebrew, or Latin; it is an anagram; it holds the 
          key to the mystery of the cards. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: The 
          earliest names for the tarot are all Italian. Originally the cards were 
          called &quot;carte da trionfi&quot; (cards of the triumphs). Around 
          1530 (about 100 years after the origin of the cards), the word &quot;tarocchi&quot; 
          (singular tarocco) begins to be used to distinguish them from a new 
          game of triumphs or trumps then being played with ordinary playing cards. 
          The etymology of this new word is not known. The German form is &quot;tarock&quot;, 
          the French form is &quot;tarot&quot; . Even if the etymology were known, 
          it would probably not tell us much about the idea behind the cards, 
          since it only came into use 100 years after they first appeared. </span></font></p>

          The symbolism of the trumps comes from Egypt (or India, or other exotic 
          locale). CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: The symbolism of the trumps 
          is drawn from the culture of Medieval and Renaissance Europe. Most tarot 
          subjects are distinctive to European Christendom. Illustrations virtually 
          identical to each of the tarot subjects can be found in European art, 
          and such precise analogs are not found in other cultures. </span></font></p>

          The gypsies brought the tarot to Europe and spread its use. CURRENT 
          HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: This idea was popularized in the 19th century 
          by several writers, notably Vaillant and Papus, without any basis in 
          historical fact. There is no evidence that the Rom (gypsies) used tarot 
          cards until the 20th century. Most of their fortune-telling was through 
          palmistry and later through the use of ordinary playing cards. </span></font></p>

          The 52-card deck evolved from the tarot, leaving the Joker as the only 
          remnant of the major arcana. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: Playing 
          cards came to Europe from Islam, probably via Muslim Spain, about 50 
          years before the development of tarot. They appeared quite suddenly 
          in many different European cities between l375 and 1378. European playing 
          cards were an adaptation of the Islamic Mamluk cards. These early cards 
          had suits of cups, swords, coins, and polo sticks (seen by Europeans 
          as staves), and courts consisting of a king and two male underlings. 
          The tarot adds the Fool, the trumps, and a set of queens to this system. 
          Some time before 1480, the French introduced cards with the now-familiar 
          suits of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds. The earlier suits are 
          still preserved in the tarot and in Italian and Spanish playing cards. 
          The Joker originated in the United States around 1857, used as a wild 
          card in poker and as the highest trump in Euchre. It appears to have 
          no direct relationship to the Fool of the tarot. </span></font></p>

          The tarot was invented to amuse Charles Vl of France in 1392, as evidenced 
          by a deck by Gringonneur in the Bibliothe Que Nationale in Paris. CURRENT 
          HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: A record exists from 1392 in which Jacquemin 
          Gringonneur was paid to paint a deck of cards for Charles Vl. This was 
          probably a set of playing cards, not tarot. The deck in the Biblioth 
          que Nationale is a late-15th century hand- painted deck of the Northern 
          Italian type (probably from Venice or Ferrara). </span></font></p>

          Monde Primitif&quot; (1781), was the first to write of a connection

          The Catholic and Protestant churches outlawed tarot and all who used 
          it in an effort to stamp out either heretical teachings or a work of 
          the Devil. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: Chief Inquisitors documented 
          in considerable detail what the church regarded as evidence of heresy 
          and the tarot is never mentioned. Many printers made their living printing 
          both religious cards and playing cards. Playing cards were sometimes 
          restricted or outlawed because of their use in gambling. Tarot cards 
          were, in fact, sometimes explicitly exempted from bans on playing cards, 
          perhaps because of their association with the upper classes. In 1423, 
          playing cards (tarot cards were not mentioned) were among many things 
          thrown on the fires in Bologna by followers of Bernadino of Sienna during 
          an attack against all studies and pastimes not focused on Religion. 
          After the Reformation, the church did object to the cards depicting 
          the Pope and Papess, and cardmakers substituted less controversial images.

          The tarot was originally used for divination/magic/teaching secret doctrines/etc. 
          CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: Written records tell that the tarot 
          was regularly used to play a card game similar to Bridge. The game was 
          popular throughout much of Europe for centuries and is still played 
          today, particularly in France. Early poets also used the titles of the 
          trump cards to create flattering verses, called &quot;tarocchi appropriati&quot;, 
          describing ladies of the court or famous personages. Although it is 
          possible that tarot cards might also have been sometimes used for other 
          purposes, there is no clear evidence of such use until long after the 
          cards were invented. Records from a trial in Venice in 1589 suggest 
          that tarot may have been associated with witchcraft (at least in the 
          minds of the accusers) at this date, about l50 years after the appearance 
          of the tarot. After this, there are no references connecting tarot with 
          magic or divination until the 18th century. (See also next three questions.)

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>INACCURATE: 
          Tarot was not used for divination before Etteilla and Court de Gebelin 
          around I781. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: There is evidence of 
          such use, but it is fragmentary and suggestive rather than conclusive. 
          Tarot was used as early as the l6th century to compose poems describing 
          personality characteristics (&quot;tarocchi appropriati&quot;). In one 
          case (l527), the verses are presented as relating to the person's fate. 
          There are records of divinatory meanings assigned to tarot cards in 
          Bologna early in the 1700s. This is the first unambiguous evidence of 
          tarot divination as it is commonly understood. However, it is known 
          that ordinary playing cards were connected with divination as early 
          as l487, so it is reasonable to conjecture that tarot was also. From 
          the l790s with Etteilla's deck we find tarot design being modified specifically 
          to reflect divinatory and esoteric meanings. </span></font></p>

          There are no hermetic, heretical, or kabbalistic characteristics in 
          the original tarot. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: This topic is 
          still open. The early Italian Renaissance, which gave birth to the tarot, 
          was a time of great intellectual diversity and activity. Hermeticism, 
          astrology, Neoplatonism, Pythagorean philosophy with roots in Alexandrian 
          Egypt, and heterodox Christian thought all thrived. Any or all of these 
          may have left their mark on the design of the tarot. Although it should 
          be remembered that all of the symbolism of the tarot has close analogs 
          in the conventional Christian culture of the time, many scholars today 
          believe that these philosophies, which are foundations of occultism, 
          were important in the design of the tarot. </span></font></p>

          The tarot has always been a pillar of the western esoteric tradition. 
          CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: The first occult writers to discuss 
          the tarot were Court de Gebelin and the Comte de Mellet in 1781. For 
          the first 350 years of its history, the tarot was not mentioned in any 
          of the many books on occult or magical philosophy. Following 178l, occult 
          interest in tarot blossomed and the tarot then became an integral part 
          of occult philosophy. </span></font></p>

          to the Tarot and corrected previous errors. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: 
          There are many, many systems of correspondences for the tarot. None 
          can be shown to go back to the tarot's origins, although the French 
          tradition exemplified in the works of Eiphas Levi predates the English 
          tradition now familiar through the works of Waite and Crowley. Most 
          sets of correspondences have a rationale and system that make them meaningful 
          and useful when studied within their own tradition. Correspondences 
          are a matter of individual choice and of intention or adherence to a

          The Waite-Smith (or &quot;Rider Waite&quot;) Tarot is the original, 
          standard, or most authentic tarot. CURRENT HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING: 
          The Waite-Smith deck was created in l909, making it a relative newcomer 
          in the almost-600-year history of the tarot. A E. Waite was a prominent 
          member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The deck owes much 
          of its symbolism to that group and represents a departure from the earlier 
          French tradition. The artist, Pamela Colman Smith, contributed her own 
          vision, especially in the innovative creation of fully illustrated scenes 
          for the minor arcana. For many years, the Waite-Smith deck was the only 
          one readily available in the US, so it became familiar to whole generations 
          of tarot readers. There is actually no &quot;definitive&quot; version 
          of the tarot. The well-known Celtic Cross spread, publicized by Waite 
          as &quot;an ancient Celtic method of divination&quot; is also relatively 
          recent, although it was not invented by Waite. Some things to be careful 
          of when writing about tarot history. The terms &quot;major arcana&quot;, 
          &quot;minor arcana&quot;, &quot;High Priestess&quot;, and &quot;Hierophant&quot; 
          are anachronistic when referring to the older tarot decks. The historically 
          appropriate terms are &quot;the trumps and the Fool&quot; (the Fool 
          was not usually regarded as a trump), the suit cards, &quot;Papess&quot; 
          or &quot;Popess&quot;, and &quot;Pope&quot;. Likewise &quot;pentacles&quot; 
          and &quot;wands&quot; are relatively recent substitutions for the traditional 
          suit names of &quot;coins&quot; and &quot;staves&quot; or &quot;batons&quot;. 
          The original Italian titles of the cards were in some cases different 
          from the later French titles (and their English translations) that have 
          become familiar to us through the Tarot de Marseille and its descendants. 
          Also, the ordering of the trumps varied considerably in Italy where 
          the cards originated; it is not known which ordering is the earliest 
          one. Even the number of cards in the deck varied a great deal! So care 
          should be used in making statements about the original meaning of the 
          cards based on the familiar titles and ordering. The intention of the 
          original designer(s) of the tarot in selecting the symbols for the trump 
          cards is unknown, although there are many conjectures, some more plausible 
          than others. Writers should avoid giving the impression that the intention 
          is known or obvious. </span></font></p>
