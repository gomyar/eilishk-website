<p><font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">Egypt: Additional Information & Itinerary</font> 
  </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The trip is available for 1 or 2 weeks. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>Week 1</u></b>, the Foundation Course, begins at 
  Luxor. From there we will travel down/up the Nile by 5 Star air-conditioned 
  cruiser, all accommodation, meals/trips to sites (see Itinerary below) included. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>Week 2</u>,</b> the Intermediate Course, includes 
  time in Luxor (b/b Hotel), visits to Cairo (b/b accommodation) & the Red Sea 
  (full board). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I am assured by my contact in Egypt that the 2 weeks 
  are well worth it for anyone who has the time. In Cairo you can buy all your 
  Xmas gifts plus enough household linen and clothes for prices that are amazing. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>Travel is via</u> </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Dublin - Paris (Ryanair/Beauvais) - (Charles De Gaulle) 
  - Luxor - Paris (Charles de Gaulle) - (Ryanair/Beauvais) for those only coming 
  for 1 week and </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Dublin - Paris (as above) - Luxor -Hurgada -Paris (as 
  above) for those doing the 2 weeks. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Family members/friends can also come along. There are 
  plenty of organised group trips and activities for them to take part in while 
  you are studying. The costs to them would be the total less the course fee. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>Cost</u></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The 1 week trip is 1150.00 (approx). </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The 2 week trip is 1480.00 (approx) - deduct 350.00 in 
  both cases if not attending the course. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The Foundation course will be taught on the cruiser and 
  other venues as mentioned. The Intermediate will be taught in Luxor, Cairo & 
  Red Sea Hotels. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>Payment</u></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you are interested, or know anyone who is, please 
  phone/email me. You will need to forward a deposit of 150.00eu immediately for 
  the trip (non-refundable) and a 50.00eu deposit for the course. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please understand that the Dublin - Paris - Dublin section 
  of the trip is by Ryanair so there are no refunds from them under any circumstances. 
  These are usually booked by individuals but the contact in Egypt, has offered 
  to book and pay the Paris leg of the trip, <u>if I have received the deposits.</u>The 
  reason for this is that Ryanair reduce their prices suddenly and we want to 
  take advantage of this whenever that happens. Regardless of what happens, this 
  portion cannot be refunded as Ryanair don't do refunds no matter what the circumstances. 
  For the same reason if, for any reason, you miss the connecting flights we cannot 
  provide you with an alternative flight or a refund. This is unlikely to happen 
  as there has been plenty of time allowed between connecting flights. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please note also that Ryanair do not transfer luggage 
  on so you have to take care of this yourself. Transport from one airport to 
  another within Paris involves 2 buses at 10 eu approx per bus which you pay 
  at the time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"> <u><b>The following details are neccessary to make the 
  Ryanair bookings:</b></u> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">· Name, as it is on your passport (Ryanair are very strict 
  about this - if there is any query they simply will not let you on a flight). 
  · An email address to get confirmation that the flight has been booked containing 
  details of valid number for getting on the flight (Ryanair is a tickless airline). 
  (If you don't have one, we will arrange something for you).· A contact phone 
  number. · Your address. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><u>Note</u></b>: </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">A couple of additional points: You need to take out your 
  own insurance.You might want to check out any immunisations you need. You need 
  a passport that is valid for 6 months after your trip to Egypt (ie from November 
  2003). Visas are collectively applied for on arrival. </font></p>
